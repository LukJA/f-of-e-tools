#	Example Source RISC-V Benchmarks

### Benchmark development

All the included libc files were compiled for hardfloat and are un-linkable 
And the port files dont work either

Sunflower cannot handle hyphens in file names 
or a newline at the end...

### Usage

make (followed by pressing q <enter> on each sf run completion)
make clean (clears output files)
